# swift-compiler-stuff
A scraped list of resources/inspiration for learning programming lang implementation in Swift

### Why?

I've become fascinated with programming language implementation and design and I think it would be amazing to make a contribution to an open source language one day üòÖ. Just a list of random resources and inspiration for me as I begin this exploration. Most references are related to Swift, as it's the language I'm most comfortable with.
